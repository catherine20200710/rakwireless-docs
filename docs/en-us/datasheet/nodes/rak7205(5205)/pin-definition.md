## Pin Definition

Here are the six connectors for RAK5205 tracker board: **P1**, **P2**, **J11**, **J12**, **J22** and **J25**

### P1

(Pin1 connected to VBATT, Pin2 connected to GND) Li-ion battery connector.

### P2

(Pin1 connected to VBUS, Pin2 connected to GND) Solar cell interface.

### J11

Pin1 is connected to VBUS. Pin2 is connected to VBIN. Without a battery
connection, the J11 needs to be short-circuited with a jumper. Instead, the J11
needs to be kept open.

### J12

Pin1 is connected to BOOT0. Pin2 is connected to VDD. Enter flash mode through jumper short circuit and open into normal mode.

### J22

30pins, follow the 96Board’s pin definition.

### J25

(RX1, RX, RXCP) J22 and USB UART share. If you use the UART of J22, you need to connect Rx and RX1 pins. If you use USB UART, you need to connect Rx and RXCP pins.
