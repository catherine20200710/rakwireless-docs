## Board Overview

RAK2287 is a compact LPWAN Gateway Module, making it suitable for integration in systems where mass and size constraints are essential. It has been designed with the PCI Express Mini Card form factor in mind, so it can easily become a part of products that comply with the standard, where they allow for cards with thickness of at least 10.5 mm.

The board has two UFL interfaces for the LoRaÂ® and GNSS antennas and a standard 52 pin connector (mPCIe).
