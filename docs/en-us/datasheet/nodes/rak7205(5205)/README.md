### Product Description

Overview and Package Contents

The **RAK5205 LPWAN tracker board** is built on the Semtech SX1276 chip, with the STM32L1 MCU at its core. It is a feature-packed sensor board with LoRa® connectivity and built-in GPS. It provides various interfaces for easy application development.

 This is the best sensor board available in the market, ideal as a quick prototyping tool for Internet-of-Things and LoRaWAN® Network integration. It is perfect for IoT applications such as asset tracking, smart vehicle management and location-based services. Most importantly, application development environments such as the CooCox IDE and Kiel are all supported, users can quickly develop own applications.

### Product Features

- Compatible with 96Boards IoT Edition Specification. 
- With SX1276 LoRa® long range and Ublox Max 7Q GPS modems which allow to
enable the GPS low power mode. 
- Integrated the ultra-low power microcontroller ARM Cortex-M3 STM32L1. 
- Built-in environmental sensor BME680 (gas, pressure, humidity, temperature) and
3-axis MEMS sensor LIS3DH (accelerometer). 
- SMA/iPEX antenna optional for LoRa® and GPS.
- Supports latest LoRaWAN® 1.0.2 protocol, activation by OTAA/ABP.
- Supports programmable bit rate up to 300kbps. 
- Supports rechargeable battery through micro USB or 5V solar charging ports. 
- Supports sleep mode, the power consumption down to 14.5μA. 
- Supports global license-free ISM band (EU433, CN470, EU868, US915, AS923, AU915, KR920, IN865 and AS920). 
- Supports I2C, GPIOs, UART and ADC interfaces.
