## Antenna Characteristics

### 1. LTE Antenna

The LTE Antenna Connector is shown below:

A PCB antenna (Figure 2) is included with the board. In case you want to use another antenna keep in mind that you need to have the proper connector (iPEX) and have it tuned to the frequency band of operation in your region.

### Environmental Requirements

The antenna environmental requirements are listed in the table below:

| Conditions | Temperature     | Humidity |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Working    | -40 ºC ~ +75 ºC | 0% ~ 95% |
| Storage    | 40 ºC ~ +85 ºC  | 0% ~ 95% |

### 2. GPS Antenna

### GPS Antenna Power Supply Control

In order to support low power and long battery life, the active GPS antenna’s power supply should be shut down when system don’t access the data from GPS module. The GPS power supply is controlled by nRF52840 with MOSFET, The pin map of GPS_EN on Nrf52840 is P1.09, and the circuit is below:

- **set P1.07=1, GPS antenna power is on;**
- **set P1.07=0, GPS antenna power is off;**
