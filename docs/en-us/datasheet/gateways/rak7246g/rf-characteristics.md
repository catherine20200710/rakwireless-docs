### Receiver RF Characteristics

It is highly recommended, to use optimized RSSI calibration values, which is part of the HAL v3.1. For both, Radio 1 and Radio 2, the RSSI-Offset should be set to -169.0.

### RF Key Components

This section introduces the key components in the RAK2246 in order to help developers to utilize the system at its fullest in their designs.

**1. DC-DC regulator**

The system power supply is provided by an external 5V DC power supply. All the key components and related clock crystals are powered by two DC-DC regulators (MP1496) which output 1.8V and 3.3V in order to meet the normal working conditions. The MP1496 is a high-frequency, synchronous, rectified, step-down, switch-mode converter with built-in power MOSFETs. It offers a very compact solution to achieve a 2A continuous output current with excellent load and line regulation over a wide input supply range.

**2. FEM**

The FEM chosen is a SKYWORKS SKY66422, which integrates a PA, LNA and a Switch. It can achieve a 20 dBm max output power in order to deliver sufficient RX performance. The frequency range it can cover from is 860MHZ~930MHz.
