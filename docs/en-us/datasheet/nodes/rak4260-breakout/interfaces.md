## Interfaces

### SWD Programming Interface

When programming via a JLINK tool, it is required to have all of the following 5 pins connected to your JLINK tool:

1. **3V3**
2. **SWDIO**
3. **SWCLK**
4. **GND**
5. **RST**

::: tip Note:
:pencil: For the aforementioned reason, it is best you leave these exposed for programming purposes and not to remap them as GPIOs.

### UART Port

There are two UART interfaces on RAK4200 module:

- **UART1** – default interface
- **UART3** – reserved, can also act as GPIOs.

### I2C Interface

**I2C_SCL** and **I2C_SDA** are connected to the ATECC608A crypto chip for the purpose of developing cryptographic applications: network end-point key management and exchange small message and PII data encryption, secure boot and protected download, ecosystem control and anti-cloning.

### RF Interface

**J4** is soldered to the antenna connector. Depending on your choice it can come with either SMA or IPEX style connector. Make sure to select the one you need when ordering.
