### Product Description

**RAK4200 Breakout Module** is specifically designed to allow easy excess to the pins on the module in order to simplify development and testing. The breakout board utilized is of an Xbee form factor and its main purpose is to allow the RAK4200 stamp module form factor pinout to be transferred to 2.54mm headers.

The module itself has the RAK4200 at its core, integrating an **STM32L071 MCU** and an **SX1276 LoRa® chip**. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 1.5uA in sleep mode and high LoRa® output power (19dBm) in work mode.

The module complies with LoRaWAN® 1.0.2 protocols. It also supports Lora® Point to Point communication.

The
low power, long range LoRa® communication capabilities of the module make it
suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home
automation, sensor networks, building automation, personal area networks applications
(health/fitness sensors and monitors, etc.).
